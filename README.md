## Getting Started

When you first explore the project, you'll find some sample slides that demonstrate how slides are built in this project.\
You have the option to use these as templates or completely discard them to begin anew.\
\
**üö®Check out this guide** to create **your first slideüö®** -> https://flutter-show-docs.vercel.app/docs/quick-start \
Once the application is running, use the _**M key**_ to open the **Menu**!

## General Information

FlutterShow consists of two main packages: `fluttershow_base` and `fluttershow_keynote`:

- [fluttershow_base](https://github.com/lucas-goldner/fluttershow_base) contains most of the pre-built widgets that are used in `fluttershow_keynote`, but can also be used to make custom slides.
- [fluttershow_keynote](https://github.com/lucas-goldner/fluttershow_keynote) is currently the default package and implements all basic slides with variations of the popular presentation software Keynote.
- FlutterShow‚ö°Ô∏è uses riverpod hooks for state management, providing a simple and quick experience for managing your state.
- FlutterShow‚ö°Ô∏è is designed to be easily expandable and customizable according to your preferences. You can switch libraries like `intl` to `easy_localizations` or use `fluttergen` for asset organization.

## Awesome features üò±

The **Menu** _(Open using **M key**)_: Toggle dark/light mode depending on the location you are presenting at or quickly jump between your slides.

### Animations

Most slides and prebuilt widgets can be animated for a smoother experience. Simply pass an `animationIndex` parameter to enable animation on the desired slide or widget.
In addition to animating individual slides and widgets, you can also animate the transitions between slides. An example of slide transition animation can be found in [`lib/slides/03_motivation/view/motivation.dart`](lib/slides/03_motivation/view/motivation.dart) file.

### Code Display

Use the `Code Display` to present your beautiful code:

### Rebindable Keys

You can easily rebind your keys for actions like navigating to the next or previous slide and opening the menu. Simply edit the actions in [`lib/presentation/config/key_actions.dart`](lib/presentation/config/key_actions.dart).

### Toggle Cursor

Using the **O key** the mouse cursor can be hidden or shown again. Optionally it is possible to set a custom cursor as it can be seen here:
